	-
	  > Replace `brew install hugo` with `brew install hugo --HEAD` if you want the absolute latest in-development version.

	- brew should have updated your path to include Hugo. You can confirm by opening a new terminal window and running a few commands:

	  ```
	  		  $ # show the location of the hugo executable
	  		  which hugo
	  		  /usr/local/bin/hugo
	  		      
	  		  # show the installed version
	  		  ls -l $( which hugo )
	  		  # at MBP15acsr:
	  		  lrwxr-xr-x  1 astro  admin  30 Apr 20 12:33 /usr/local/bin/hugo -> ../Cellar/hugo/0.97.3/bin/hugo
	  		  
	  		  # verify that hugo runs correctly
	  		  hugo version
	  		  # Hugo Static Site Generator v0.13 BuildDate: 2015-03-09T21:34:47-05:00 # from example
	  		  hugo v0.97.3+extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate=unknown  # at MBP15acsr
	  ```

#### Next Steps [](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#next-steps)

	  Now that you’ve installed Hugo, read the [Quick Start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and explore the rest of the documentation. If you have questions, ask the Hugo community directly by visiting the [Hugo Discussion Forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/).

### [Setup](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

### Quick Start

Create a Hugo site using the beautiful Ananke theme.

- This quick start uses [[macOS]] in the examples. For instructions about how to install Hugo on other operating systems, see [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
- It is required to have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to run this tutorial.
- For other approaches to learning Hugo (like books or video tutorials), refer to the [external learning resources](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/external-learning-resources/) page.

#### Step 1: Install Hugo

- DONE Check installed version

### Step 2: Create a New Site 

```
mkdir -p /Users/astro/github/Hugo
cd /Users/astro/github/Hugo
hugo new site quickstart
```

The above will create a new Hugo site in a folder named ``quickstart``.
- output:

  ```
    Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/astro/github/Hugo/quickstart.

    Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

    1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
        Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
        create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
    2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
        with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
    3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

    Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
  ```

### Step 3: Add a Theme 
	  
See themes.gohugo.io for a list of themes to consider. This quickstart uses the beautiful Ananke theme.

- First, download the theme from GitHub and add it to your site’s themes directory:

    ```
    cd quickstart
    git init
    git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
    ```

- Then, add the theme to the site configuration:

    ```
    echo theme = \"ananke\" >> config.toml
    ```

- output:
    
    ```
    Cloning into '/Users/astro/github/Hugo/quickstart/themes/ananke'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 2496, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (519/519), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (286/286), done.
    remote: Total 2496 (delta 261), reused 403 (delta 199), pack-reused 1977
    Receiving objects: 100% (2496/2496), 4.45 MiB | 4.83 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (1358/1358), done.
    ```

### Step 4: Add Some Content 
	  
You can manually create content files (for example as `content/<CATEGORY>/<FILE>.<FORMAT>`) and provide metadata in them, however you can use the `new` command to do a few things for you (like add title and date):

-  ```
    hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
    ```

- output:

    ```
    Content "/Users/astro/github/Hugo/quickstart/content/posts/my-first-post.md" created
    ```

- Edit the newly created content file if you want, it will start with something like this:
		  
    ```
    ---
    title: "My First Post"
    date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
    draft: true
    ---
    ```

    > Drafts do not get deployed; once you finish a post, update the header of the post to say `draft: false`. More info [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content).


### Step 5: Start the Hugo server [](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-5-start-the-hugo-server)

Now, start the Hugo server with [drafts](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content) enabled:

    ```
    ▶ hugo server -D
